# Advent of Code 2022

## Days I was unable to complete without hints/solutions

### Day 11 Part 2

Had to look up answer. Failed on modulo operations.

### Day 16 Part 1 & 2

Had to look up someone elses answer. Failed on solving at all.
Problem was graph problem:

-   Transforming graph by removing 0-flow valves
-   Caching previously seen states

### Day 19, Part 1 & 2

Had to look at hints.

-   Pruning of search space.

### Day 22

"Brute-force" approach (enumerate all side -> side transitions manually).

-   Better solution would be to rotate the cube faces into the correct arrangement - 3D rotations
